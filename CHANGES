WHATS NEW IN 1.0.3

* actually seems to be working right, unlike 1.0.1 and 1.0.2, which were both
  buggy as hell under many (most?) conditions. If 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 locked up, 
  went berzerk, or did other strange and horrible things when you used them,
  try 1.0.3.
* dc-tool should now be able to recover from dropped packets in nearly all
  cases (prior versions would just get stuck if certain packets got dropped)
* gethostinfo syscall now returns the dreamcast's ip, in addition to the ip
  and port of the dc-tool host
* dcload-ip now reports "link change..." on the status line while the rtl8139
  is negotiating. This message should be displayed momentarily when dcload-ip
  starts, when you execute dc-tool -r, or if you disconnect and reconnect the
  ethernet cable. If the message stays there, check your ethernet cable.

WHATS NEW IN 1.0.2

* fixed bug where rx configuration was not restored properly
  (only affected dcload syscalls - could cause dc-tool to segfault apparently,
   and who knows what else...)

WHATS NEW IN 1.0.1

* works with 100mbit now
* added syscall to return the ip and port of the dc-tool host
* added O_BINARY to all open()s in dc-tool to help cygwin users

WHATS NEW IN 1.0.0

* initial release of dcload-ip
